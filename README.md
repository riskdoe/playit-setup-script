# playit-setup-script
A script to set up the [playit.gg](https://playit.gg/) tunnel host and install it as a service on Linux.  But why would you even want that?
- If playit is running as a systemd service, you don't need to worry about restarting it if your machine ever shuts down,  It will start automatically whenever your machine starts up.
- It's much quicker to restart it when it's a service, because all you need is one command, rather than two or three.
- Single command installers are nice, particularly when you're dealing with a service.
- Running anything as a service means that you don't have to have a terminal window open 24/7.  It also means that you can access your server via SSH, view or manage the tunnel, and it will remain running after you close your SSH session.  (That is actually the primary reason I run it as a service.)

Even if you don't want it as a service, this script automates installation and ensures that playit is executable, all with a single command!

## Usage
### Debian/Ubuntu, Raspberry Pi (Raspbian)
The script doesn't need to be run as root, it will elevate permissions when it needs to.
```bash
bash <(curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aBoredDev/playit-setup-script/main/playit-setup.sh))
```
And that's it!

If you just want to install the tunnel host without setting up a service, use the following command:
```bash
bash <(curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aBoredDev/playit-setup-script/main/playit-setup.sh) --no-service
```
And if you only want to set up a systemd service for playit, you can use
```bash
bash <(curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aBoredDev/playit-setup-script/main/playit-setup.sh) --service-only
```
## Viewing the tunnel host
To view the tunnel host once it is running as a service, use the following command:
```bash
screen -r playit.gg
```
To exit the tunnel host and return to the terminal session, use __Ctrl+A D__.  This will detach you from the screen session and return you to your previous terminal session.  If you use Ctrl+C, it will terminate the tunnel host.  If this happens, simply restart the tunnel host using `systemctl start playit`.

## Managing the service
To manage any service on Linux under systemd, you use the `systemctl` command.
- To stop the playit service, run `sudo systemctl stop playit`.
- To start the playit service, run `sudo systemctl start playit`.
- To restart the playit service, run `sudo systemctl restart playit`.
- To view the status of the playit service, run `systemctl status playit`.

For more information on the systemctl command, see [this article](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-systemctl-to-manage-systemd-services-and-units) on DigitalOcean, or the [man page](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/systemctl.1.html).

Credit for the original idea goes to \_-\_\_â€”\_\_-#5324 on Discord.  I saw him mention making an auto-update/installer script, and since I didn't see any mention of one anywhere, I decided to take a crack at it myself.
